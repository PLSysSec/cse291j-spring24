    **CSE 291-J: Blockchain Security**
         [*Stefan Savage*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/) and [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This course focuses on the security of blockchain technologies. Students will
be introduced to many parts of the blockchain infrastructure — from the design
and implementation of consensus protocols, to the programming layers above
them, and the DeFi applications handling billions of dollars — and explore the
different ways these systems can—and have—failed under adversarial settings. We
will study attacks against real systems, revisit the security and assumptions
of widely deployed protocols and applications, and analyze the impact of
attacks, scams, and thefts.
